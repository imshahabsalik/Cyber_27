The **Hotel Booking System** is a Python-based desktop application designed to simplify hotel management for both customers and administrators. It allows users to **register, log in, browse available rooms, make bookings, and complete payments** through an intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter. The system ensures that customers can easily check room availability by specifying check-in and check-out dates, and view detailed information such as room type, price, and booking status. Once a booking is confirmed, users can securely record payments and review their booking history. On the administrative side, the system provides a dedicated **admin panel** where hotel staff can **manage room inventory, update room details, view and approve bookings, track payments, and handle customer or staff records**. All data is stored persistently in a local SQLite database, making the application lightweight and reliable. Overall, it offers a complete and user-friendly solution for automating hotel booking and management operations.
